## [Demo](https://patheticmustan.itch.io/unlight)
Lightn't, the game Unlight is a top-down stealth-based psychological horror dungeon crawler revolving around the 
use of light in order to safely traverse an abandoned office.
It focuses on the usage of a flashlight to explore your surroundings and complete puzzles. By using this 
flashlight to your advantage you can descend the office building you are stuck in, however many different 
monsters live in the building and are ready to tear you to shreds if you aren't careful.
